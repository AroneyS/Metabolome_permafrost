These FT-IR numbers are based on E3 S small vial (which was fully ground by some undergraduate, probably Danielle). There was also another vial of partially-ground peat, which gave very similar results, but when this was reground, the results were different. After the FT-IR and C/N data were run, the reground vial was combined with the small vial so that there would be a combined >100mg of fully-ground peat to send for solid-phase FT-ICR MS (this was done on 2/11/15).
